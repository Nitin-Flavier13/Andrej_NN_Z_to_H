# ðŸ§  Neural Networks: Zero to Hero â€“ Notes & Implementations

This repository contains my personal notes, code, and experiments based on **Andrej Karpathyâ€™s** [Neural Networks: Zero to Hero](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLpOqH6AE0tNlLx1Gfsj4O2eN6V1pGgN5P) YouTube series.

The goal of this project is to deeply understand neural networks from first principles by building everything from scratch, without relying on high-level libraries like TensorFlow or PyTorch.

## ðŸ“Œ Topics Covered

- Building a neural net from scratch (no frameworks)
- Backpropagation and gradient descent
- Training a bigram language model

Will be adding more soon....
